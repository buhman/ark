ark
===

A silly game (in the sense that it is appallingly horribly written) using sdl2

installation
------------

No distribution that I know of packages [SDL2][] and [SDL2_gfx][] that I know of, but these are required to run ark. For archlinux, you can find both in the AUR: [aur/sdl2][] [aur/sdl2-gfx-svn][]

[SDL2]: http://www.libsdl.org/
[SDL2_gfx]: http://www.ferzkopp.net/joomla/content/view/19/14/

[aur/sdl2]: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/sdl2/
[aur/sdl2-gfx-svn]: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/sdl2-gfx-svn/

Once the dependencies are installed, (along with glibc, g++, and make) you'll be able to build ark (using make of course).
